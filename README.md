## Features
- **Carbon Emission Calculator**: Calculate emissions from transportation, residential, and office sectors.
- **Map Analysis with Google Earth Engine**: Visualize emission data on interactive maps.
- **Leaflet Routing Machine**: Provides route planning with suggestions to help users reduce their carbon footprint.

## Project Goals
1. Develop a web application leveraging geospatial data for real-time monitoring of carbon emissions.
2. Increase awareness of climate change and encourage sustainable infrastructure in alignment with SDG 9.
3. Enable data-driven decision-making for environmental sustainability.

## Architecture
The application uses the following technologies:
- **Ionic Framework**: Hybrid app framework supporting web and mobile platforms.
- **Angular**: Front-end framework for a responsive user interface.
- **Leaflet**: WebGIS library for mapping.
- **Firebase**: Backend for real-time data and authentication.
- **Google Earth Engine**: Geospatial analysis and visualization.

## Location Study
The project focuses on monitoring emissions in these areas of Yogyakarta, Indonesia:
- Kulon Progo
- Sleman
- Bantul
- Kota Yogyakarta
- Gunung Kidul

## CO2 Data Analysis
C-Maps categorizes CO and CO₂ emissions by source, including:
- **Transportation**
- **Offices & Residential**

Emission data is visualized over time, showing that transportation is currently the largest contributor to CO₂ levels.

## Application Development Roadmap
- **Short-term**: Optimize loading speed for better user experience.
- **Medium-term**: Regular updates and maintenance.
- **Long-term**: API integration, hybrid app conversion, and advanced hosting.
